### Hi there 👋

My name is Tomas Macchi and I'm a lawyer and self-taught full-stack developer!

Throughout the years I have done many things before becoming a developer, from
graduating from Law School to manage a restaurant. I have learned a
lot in my different roles gaining sufficient knowledge and skills to thrive in different types of organizations.

Ever since the pandemic I've decided to get into programming, it was at that moment
where I switched my career to another direction.
In the begging, I focused on problem-solving skills and algorithms, afterwards
I enrolled in a Bootcamp to learn in-demand skills in the industry

Currently, I'm working as a Backend Developer for Mutual LDS Dating App

I enjoy what I do every day! Always self-teaching to myself new technologies
and features.
